### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Md Saiful Islam
#### A knowledge hunter, software engineer from Bangladesh
I'm Md Saiful Islam, currently I'm working as a Software Engineer. I pursued BSc degree on Computer Science & Engineering major from Khulna University of Engineering & Technology.

I have felt blessed because I have started my engineering career since I was in my last semester of BSc degree. After that I got back to back two promotion and now I'm playing Team Lead role. 

I love technologies and I believe in "Love What you do, do What you love"
